## An Introduction


The FuseDojo Code website has been created as a sub-project to the main FuseDojo site in order to explore programming and web development. Inevitably in web development you will come across HTML, CSS and Javascript. On this site, you will be able to learn the basics of web development and monthly, we will create new projects ranging from websites to dynamic web apps. This site is currently under construction, so please stay tuned for new updates soon. In the meanwhile, you can visit the main FuseDojo website in which we discuss electronics, medical and scientific topics and alongside this explore projects including the Arduino framework.

## Language Breakdown

In order to familiarise yourselves with the languages covered in the course of these posts, take a look at the language breakdown table:

| Language                                        | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML                                        | HTML, also known as Hyper-Text-Markup-Language is the language of the web. It can encapsulate CSS and Javascript code inside it and is capable of creating a skeleton of a site.                  |
| CSS | CSS, also known as Cascading-Style-Sheets is a low-level language which is used with HTML in order to style web pages, adding styles such as sizing of elements, colours and fonts. |
| Javascript  | Javascript is the brains of your website. It powers a website giving it dynamic abilities such as form validation and backend logic which can easily be connected to a nice UI created by HTML and CSS at the frontend.|
