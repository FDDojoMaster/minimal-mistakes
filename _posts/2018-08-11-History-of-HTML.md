## An Introduction to HTML

HTML, which is also known as HyperText Markup Language is the language of the web. The websites you visit are all written in some form of HTML alongside CSS and Javascript. The HTML language follows the DOM or the Document Object Model. Take a look at the previous post here to learn more. In this DOM model, we use a series of tags to define elements on the page.

## The Brief History of HTML

In 1993, a British Physicist named Tim-Berners-Lee wrote the initial HTML framework with the motive of using web browsers to recieve data from web servers and output HTML files to the user which were interactive and had multimedia capabilities with basic buttons, inputs and text. After 1995, Berners-Lee had released HTML V.2.0 which was a fully packaged language including Hyperlinks and other elements such as images. You can find the full timeline of the HTML release versions on the HTML wikipedia page here. Currently, HTML is associated with W3C which was founded by Tim-Berners-Lee. On their website they have information regarding web protocols and the HTML language. Recently, in 2014, HTML probably had itâ€™s most famous revamp/update to HTML5.
