# HTML Reference

In this article/post, we will look at a broad range of HTML tags and in the tables below, you will be able to see each tag listed, with a brief description of what it does and an example. You can use this page as reference for your HTML coding as it is not expected for you to remember every single tag when you are writing an HTML page. In fact, even proffessional programmers use reference guides during projects! Take a look at the tables below:
