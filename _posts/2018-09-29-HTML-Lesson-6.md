# HTML Summary- What have we done so far?

Apologies for the late post, due to the high workload it is difficult to find time to keep this site updated....

In the previous 5 lessons, you learnt the very basics of the HTML programming language. Now that you are armed with this knowledge, we can begin to embark on some more complex projects that include real-world applications such as a basic contact form with validation using javascript. More of these types of projects wil be added in due course. Many of the projects we will do on this site may include concepts unfamiliar to you, but they will be explained as we go along.

## Breakdown of Basics

* The History of HTML
* HTML Basic Tags
* The Document Object Model (DOM)
* Buttons, Inputs and Text elements
* Custom Website Building
* Web app development
* Styling pages with CSS
* Adding dynamic pages to your site with Javascript
* Search Engine Optimisation Tutorial (SEO)
* Many more Projects to come soon!


There will also be an advanced course for those who want to get stuck into more complex projects including creating our own chat app and making user authentication systems.

In the next post, we will build our own contact form using the CSS framework Bootstrap. If unsure of what it is, please visit their site [here ](https://getbootstrap.com){:target="_blank"}.
Bootstrap is a great styling framework in which it provides nice styles for different elements such as buttons and inputs. More will be explained in the next lesson. In short, UI kits such as Bootstrap make life a lot easier for web developers as they already do the hard work in styling elements and makes it only a matter of seconds to integrate these styles onto your own web page. 

## Future Projects:

Although there are many projects out there, your suggestions are always welcomed so please email the dojomaster @ dojomaster@fusedojo.com
