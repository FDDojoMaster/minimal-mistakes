# An Introduction into HTML tags

##  HTML Syntax - Tags:

Understanding the syntax of HTML is paramount in allowing you to code efficiently and accurately in the language. HTML, which is also known as Hypertext markup language makes use of native tags that represent elements such as buttons, labels,paragraphs and headings and much more. Tags take their shape in pairs, one as an opening tag like so: <code><body></code> and one acts as the closing tag like so: <code></body></code>. Notice that the closing tag is not identical to the opening tag but has a backslash to indicate that it is a closing tag. This is important to understand as almost all the code you write in HTML5 will need to have opening and closing tags. To further accelerate our understanding of this, let us take a look at a code example below:

## A look at some tags in HTML5:

| Tag        | Function           | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| <code></h1></code>|  Header/title | The <code></h1></code> tag is the largest heading tag used for titles. As the numbers appended to the h tag increases, the size decreases.  |
| <code></p></code>     | Paragraph      |  This tag represents smaller text which is ideal for paragraphs.|
| <code></div></code> | Divider     |  This tag acts as a divider in your code, and can be used to encapsulate different sections in the body. |
| <code></a></code> | Link     |  This tag acts as a link in which you can link text to links in or out of the website using the "href" attribute which we will discuss later. |





# Conclusion

This concludes todayâ€™s lesson. So to recap, we talked about tags, inputs and buttons. Armed with this information and your knowledge about basic HTML tags such as the h1 and pIn the next lesson we will look at some exercises that you can do to recap on the content covered in the last two lessons and from then on, we can begin to lock horns with creating web apps and websites.
